Linguistics
Phonetics - how speech souds are produced and perceived
Phonology - sound patterns and changes
Morphology - Word structure
Syntax - Sentence structure
Semantics - Linguistic meaning
Pragmatics - language use in CONTEXT
 
Linguistics are the key to prompt engineering.
 
 
#BEST PRACTICES

ZERO SHOT - NO TRAINING EXAMPLES, JUST QUERYING
Few Shot - provide some data/examples to help guide the LLM


Three types of prompts that exist
A few foundational principles
REDUCTIVE OPERATIONS
Summarization, Distillation (purify the principles or facts), Extraction, Characterizing (describe the content), ANalyzing(finding patterns)
Evaluation (measuring, grading, or judging the content)
Critiquing (feedback within the context of the text) recommendations to improve
TRANSFORMATIONAL OPERATIONS
Input and output the same size and meaning
Reformatting, Refactoring, Language Change, Restructuring, Modification (rewrite for different intention), Clarification (making text more comprehensible)
GENERATIVE OPERATIONS (EXPANSION OR MAGNIFICATION)
Input < Output (going small to big)
Drafting (instructions, create document)
Planning (parameters, create plans)
Brainstorming (use imagination to list possibilities)
Amplification (articulate and explain something further)

Latent and Emergence
Bloom's Taxonomy (how we learn from simple to complex)
Remembering (bottom of the pyramid of learning)
Understanding (explain the idea or concept)
Applying Using information in new situations
Analyzing (drawing connections between ideas)
Evaluating (justifying a decision or action)
Creating (producing new or original work, top of the pyramid)

Latent content (the buried treasure)
Training data
World Knowledge
Scientific information
Cultural Knowledge
Historical Knowledge
Languages

Emergent Capabilities
Theory of Mind (Understanding the content of minds), LLMs have enough to know how humans think
Implied Cognition (thinking with the right prompting)
Logical Reasoning (INductive and Deductive Reasoning)
In-Context Learning (Use information not in training data, adapt to novel information)


 Prompt Tips
 1. Provide the model a name for the person and a personality (friendly, professional)
 2. Background (years of experience in a particular domain)
 Improves outputs, sets clear expectations, supports branding

 Define Roles
 1. Financial Advisor
 2. Software Developer
 3. Nutritionist
 4. Language Tutor
 Benefits: Focused expertise, User trust, customization, versatility

 Task (OBjectives)
 1. Info Retrieval
 2. Problem Solving
 3. Content Creation
 4. Decision supports

 Explicit instructions
 Iterative Refinement
 Benefits, clarity, targeted response, enhanced functionality, user satisfaction

 Check out this github, GPT engineering

Components of a good prompt
1. Task (Mandatory)

ALways start this sentence with an action verb (generate, write, analyze, etc. Can use multiple in the sentence)

2. Context (Important)

User background, what does sucesss look like, what environment are they in

3. Exemplar (Important)

Including examples drastically improves quality of output
Resume example:  I accomplished X, by the measure Y that resulted in Z. (e.g. I lowered the mortality rate by 10%, by educating nurses which translates to 20 lives saved per year)

Use the STAR framework, Situation, Task, Action, Result

This improves the quality of the output

4. Persona (Nice To Have)

Title of the person you want GPT to be.  Can use famous people only when they are famous enough.  

5. Format (Nice To Have)
6. Tone (Nice To Have)
