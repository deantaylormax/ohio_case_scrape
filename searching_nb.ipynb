      "33 {¶ 67}   There are no extraordinary circumstances in the case before us.  The fraudulent  conduct alleged in the complaint is wrongful concealment of fi nancial misappropr iation of Mt.  Carmel’s funds.  Again, in essence, this is a cl aim of misconduct on the part  of the pastor.  If  the members of the church are aggrieved by the pastor’s conduct, the constitution provides a  remedy.  The chairman of deacons or any memb er of the congregation in good standing may  initiate charges against the pastor.  A 90-day period then ensues for resolution of the grievance.  If the charge is not resolved, the chairman or any member may call for a meeting of the congregation to consider th e pastor’s termination.  See Article VIII, Section 2 of the Mt. Carmel  Constitution.  There is no indication that S mith attempted to follow this process.   {¶ 68}    Ex. 2 attached to the Third Verified Complaint is a letter from an attorney  representing a committee of 30 members of Mt. Carmel.
